3.0.2 (2018-08-30):
Multi-output bugfixes
* BREAKING CHANGES
    * upload_media had to go to make multi-output work in a reasonable way. I did this without
      thinking, which is why 2.2.0 wasn't marked as breaking. I realized I didn't have an easy way
      to restore it, so I'm just admitting this is breaking now.  Replace calls to upload_media
      followed by send_with_many_media just with send_with_many_media - it will do the upload_media
      appropriate for the given service.

* BUGFIXES
    * send_with_many_media in outputs has unnecessary (and broken?) use of splat operator
    * mastodon actually extremely misused splats
    * didn't pass up extra keys while adapting old birdsite records to new multirecords
    * mastodon output didn't pass media ids when sending correctly, meaning images never made it to
      toots

2.2.0 (2018-08-17):
Multi-output
* FEATURES
    * Support more than one site!!!
    * Rework output from skeleton so it doesn't assume only one site output.
    * Move birdsite to a new output separate from the main one.
    * Add support for Mastodon.
    * Change record formatting to multi-output site, convert old records in-place.

2.0.5 (2018-05-22):
Bugfixes
    * BUGFIXES
        * Dump errors from birdsite as text, so json dumping works easily.
